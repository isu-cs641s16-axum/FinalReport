The following are the terms used in the formalization of the logical plan.

\begin{lstlisting}
  Inductive tm: Set :=
  | t_filter: id -> id -> tm
  | t_foreach: id -> id -> tm
  | t_group: id -> col -> tm
  | t_join: id -> col -> id -> col -> tm
  | t_load: id -> ty -> tm
  | t_assign: id -> tm -> tm
  | t_store: id -> tm
  | t_seq: tm -> tm -> tm.
\end{lstlisting}

The terms for \texttt{FILTER}, \texttt{FOREACH}, \texttt{GROUP} and \texttt{JOIN} represent the query terms in the formalization of logical plan and the \texttt{LOAD}, \texttt{ASSIGN}, \texttt{STORE}, and \texttt{SEQ} terms are the statements.

The following are the terms used in the physical plan.

\begin{lstlisting}
  Inductive tm: Type :=
   | t_filter: id -> id -> tm
   | t_foreach: id -> id -> tm
   | t_lrearrange: id -> col -> tm
   | t_grearrange: id -> col -> tm
   | t_package : id -> col -> tm
   | t_load: id -> ty -> tm
   | t_assign: id -> tm -> tm
   | t_store: id -> tm
   | t_seq: tm -> tm -> tm.
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the physical plan is just like the logical plan, except that \texttt{GROUP} and \texttt{JOIN} have been replaced by \texttt{LOCAL REARRANGE},
\texttt{GLOBAL REARRANGE}, and \texttt{PACKAGE}.
