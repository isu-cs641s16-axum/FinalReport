In this report we describe our work developing components of a formalization of Pig Latin. This preliminary work is motivated by the problem of validating the compilation of programs written in high-level Pig Latin programs to executable MapReduce programs. We used the Coq proof assistant to formalize the Pig Latin language itself and to formalize an intermediate representation used in its compilation (i.e. the ``physical plan''); we also offer preliminary work defining Pig Latin denotational semantics for use in proofs of compilation correctness. Our Pig Latin language is expressive enough to represent five core features of Pig Latin programming model (queries performed over relations, nested non-atomic data types, user defined functions, imperative/dataflow language, and parallelizability); our correctness constraints are general enough that they should be useful in modeling the propositions to-be-proven to prove the correctness of a particular compilation and execution model.
