In this report we propose a COQ formalization of the imperative dataflow language model for Pig system. In particular our focus is onto the compilation of programs written in high level Pig Latin language. We formalized different phases of Pig Latin compilation with the goal to prove a formal correctness and mapping between them. In particular we have modeled the logical plan and physical plan phases of Pig Latin compilation. Our formalization represents the core features of Pig Latin language model such as high level queries defined over relations, nested non-atomic data types, user defined functions and sequential dataflow language to define dependencies between queries.
