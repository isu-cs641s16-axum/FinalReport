\section{Meta-theory}
\label{sec:soundness}

We have not yet proven the standard soundness properties, since our formalization
does not yet include traditional operational semantics.

We instead offer a strategy for

\begin{lstlisting}
 Fixpoint support (s: schema_ty) : Type :=
  match s with
  | STyNil => unit
  | a *** => helper a
  | a *** s1 => (helper a) * support s1
  end
 with helper(c: col_ty) : Type :=
  match c with
  | CTyNat => nat
  | CTyBag s_nested => multiset (support s_nested)
  end.
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
 Inductive relation (s: schema_ty) : Type :=
  | Relation: multiset (support s) -> relation s.
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
 Definition relation_data (s: schema_ty) (r: relation s) :
    multiset (support s) :=
  match r with
  | Relation _ mset => mset
  end.
\end{lstlisting}
